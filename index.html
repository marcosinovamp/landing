      <p>If you are not approved, we will worry no more about you, we will not call you to anounce the result or to communicate in any capacity with you. If you are not a approved customer, you simply are not important enough to exist.</p>
      <p>If you are a human being, i. e. you are an approved customer, we will call you on the number you gave us on your appliance form to inform you of your selection. From the moment the call is finished, you will have <strong>10 minutes</strong>(extra time will not be given under ANY circumstance) to make the payment of the value and on the account we will inform you on this selfsame call. We cannot stress enough that <strong>payment IS NOT REFUNDABLE</strong>.</p>
